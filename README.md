# The Growroom

SPACE10 envision a future, where we grow our own food much more locally. To spark conversations about how we can bring nature back into our cities, grow our own food and tackle the rapidly increasing demand for significantly more food in the future, we teamed up with architects Sine Lindholm and Mads-Ulrik Husum to create [The Growroom](https://medium.com/space10-the-farm/space10-open-sources-the-growroom-aa7ca6621715#.jkt6zxkk9). Standing tall as a spherical garden, it empowers people to grow their own food much more locally in a beautiful and sustainable way.
From Taipei to Helsinki and from Rio de Janeiro to San Francisco, the original version of The Growroom sparked interest and people requested to either buy or exhibit The Growroom. But it doesn’t make sense to promote local food production and then start shipping it across oceans and continents. That is why we now release The Growroom as open source design and encourage people to build their own locally as a way to bring new opportunities to life.
